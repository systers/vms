#How to Submit...

##Issues

1. Go to the main page of the systers/vms Github repository
2. Under the name of the name of the repository, click the "Issues" button
3. Make a "New issue" - Make sure that the title is short and concise,
    while the description is detailed enough to provide background information
    to assist others in helping you solve the issue
4. Submit the issue

####Tips

* Remember: If you look at your issue and cannot immediately know the context of the problem, then you must add more detail!
* Pictures are worth a thousand words - this is definitely true for issues!

##Proposing Features

Possible features are also added in the issues section, and you should follow a similar procedure as when you create an issue. However, there are some other things you have to do with features.

* In the description, make bullet points of the specific aspects of the feature you want added
* Propose possible ways to approach the creation of the feature

##Adding Features

Adding features follows a whole different process which entails submitting a pull request to the main repository.

1.  Create a branch from the main repo - here, you can edit and make the changes that you would like to add
2. Go to your repository's page on Github, click "New Pull Request", then "Create Pull Request"
3. If the moderators approve of your feature, it will be added to the main project repository! 

##Bugs

Submitting bugs follows the same process as submitting an issue as well, but in your description, you should detail:

* What the expected outcome was
* How the bug may have come about, if you have any ideas
*  Remember: Be detailed and provide pictures!
