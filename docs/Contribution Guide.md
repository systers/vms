# Contribution Guide

The VMS project is always looking for more contributors like you! Before you begin however, you should install and get the project running. Click [here](https://github.com/systers/vms/blob/master/docs/Installation%20Guide.md#installation-guide) for the installation guide. Always make sure that you are working with the latest version of the project, as your concerns may have already been addressed. Remember that coding is not the only method of contributing. You can help with documentation, QA, user interface, and much more!

##Creating pull requests

If you there is a bug/issue/feature in the [issue list](https://github.com/systers/vms/issues) that you want to tackle, just clone the VMS repository and make the necessary changes. If you have a working solution, push your changes to your forked VMS repository, and then make a [pull request](https://github.com/systers/vms/compare). Please try to push ONLY the relevant changes, which also means you will only need to add one new commit. You should also reference the issue you are addressing in the body of the pull request by adding something like "closes #X" where X is the number of the issue. This will auto close the issue if your code gets merged.
