**Issue Title:**
[UI] Wireframe Design for homepage #1034
This issue will get solve if you have created a proper Home page UI using wireframe containing proper header, footer and other functionalities in a well organised and more attractive way.


**Getting Started:**
As we have to design a wireframe a template image is given and according to that we have to create a UI wireframe.

**Prerequisites:**
To work with wireframe, you need install a software application. There are various applications available, but I would like to go with Balsamiq. Here is the link to download it:

https://balsamiq.com/

You can either download it or use cloud trial.


**Installation for windows:**

With admin rights
Start by downloading "Balsamiq_Wireframes_4.0.XX_x64_Setup.exe" and running it, choosing the option to "Install for all users".
If vc_redist is not installed, installer will install it
If .NET 4.7 is not present (Windows <10.1803), installer will install it.


Without admin rights
If they're not already installed, you'll need to make sure the prerequisites are installed (with admin rights):
vc_redist 32-bit or vc_redist 64-bit
.NET 4.7
You'll then be able to run installer without admin rights.



**Built With:**
balsamiq - The web framework used
