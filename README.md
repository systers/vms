Systers Portal - VMS project
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/systers/vms.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/systers/vms) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/systers/vms/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/systers/vms?branch=develop) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)


Systers has many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to
our vision and projects. The **Volunteer Management System** (VMS) will
be useful for volunteer coordinators, volunteer sign-up, tracking hours, and 
reporting.

**This project is under active development.** 

VMS is live [here](http://52.8.110.63/).

If you are an Outreachy Applicant, start with reading [this](https://github.com/systers/ossprojects/wiki/Volunteer-Management-System).

Features
--------

The VMS will be developed in phases. The initial implementation will track 
volunteers' contact information, enable administrators to track volunteer
hours, and allow reporting of useful information.

The [requirements document](docs/Systers_GSoC14_VMS_Requirements.pdf) gives
additional detail on the project's scope.


Installation
------------

The VMS project uses the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web
framework and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

To get started, read the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/systers/vms/blob/develop/docs/Installation%20Guide.md).


Run VMS in a Docker Container
-----------------------------

If you wish to view a speak peek of the Systers VMS, you may use Docker to
preview the VMS.
Note: The following Docker configuration is not intended to be run in
production at the moment. It may be configured to do so in the future.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
   Follow the installation steps for your specific operating system:
     * Docker runs natively on a Linux-based system.
     * For Windows and Mac OS X, you should follow instructions for installing
       boot2docker which also installs VirtualBox.
1. Install [docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
   Note: fig has been deprecated. Docker-compose replaces fig.
1. Create a new directory on your local system.
1. Enter `git clone git@github.com:systers/vms.git` to clone the Systers
   VMS repository. After the clone is done, change directory (cd) to the
   `vms` directory.
1. Run `docker-compose build`. This pulls the Docker images required to run the
   project and installs the necessary dependencies.
1. Run `docker-compose run web python vms/manage.py migrate`.
1. *Optional:*
   Run `docker-compose run web python vms/manage.py createsuperuser`
   if you wish to create a superuser to access the admin panel.
1. Run `docker-compose up` to start the webserver for the Django Systers VMS
   project.
1. Systers VMS should be running on port 8000.
     * If you are on Linux, enter `http://0.0.0.0:8000` in your browser.
     * If you are using boot2docker on Windows or Mac OS X, enter
       `http://192.168.59.103:8000/` in your browser. If this IP address
       doesn't work, run `boot2docker ip` from the command line and replace
       the previous IP address in the HTTP request with the IP returned by
       boot2docker.
