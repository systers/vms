Systers Portal - VMS project
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/systers/vms.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/systers/vms) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/systers/vms/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/systers/vms?branch=develop)

Systers has many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to
our vision and projects. The **Volunteer Management System** (VMS) will
be useful for volunteer coordinators, volunteer sign-up, tracking hours, and 
reporting.

**This project is under active development.**
