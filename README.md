Systers Portal - VMS project
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/systers/vms.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/systers/vms) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/systers/vms/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/systers/vms?branch=develop) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)


Systers has many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to
our vision and projects. The **Volunteer Management System** (VMS) will
be useful for volunteer coordinators, volunteer sign-up, tracking hours, and
reporting.

Systers is participating in [Google Code In 2016](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/). The issues labelled as [gci16](https://github.com/systers/vms/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agci16) are open for GCI'16 participants only. If you want to contribute to VMS, pick any issue other than these.


**This project is under active development.**
